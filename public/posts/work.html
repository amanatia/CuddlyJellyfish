<h4 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #EAE4D5;">Remote or Office Work?</h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    For me, the ideal solution lies somewhere in between: the hybrid model. 
    This way, I get the best of both worlds.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #EAE4D5;"> Working Remotely</h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    There’s something uniquely satisfying about choosing which days I want to work from home.
    The freedom to set my own schedule is a huge benefit. 
    Working remotely gives me an extra 1.5 hours of sleep each day (time I otherwise would have spent commuting).
    And let's not forget breakfast: I can make a nice, hot cup of coffee and prepare a proper meal
    without the rush.
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    I also get to enjoy the comfort of my pajamas, something I can't exactly pull off in an office setting. 
    Speaking of which, choosing office attire every day can be a challenge. 
    It’s a delicate balance: I want to look professional, but not too boring or provocative. 
    It also has to be weather-appropriate (which can be tricky when the office air conditioning is on 
    full hot blast in the winter, or blasting cold air during summer, making it either 30℃ or -1℃!).
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Another major perk is the clock-out time. 
    At exactly 5:30 PM, I’m done with work. I can close my laptop, step away from my desk, 
    and do whatever I want no traffic, no delays, no weather conditions holding me back. 
    This makes the post-work hours feel so much more fulfilling.
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Moreover, the option to work from various locations means I can visit family, 
    like my parents, and still get work done. This has brought more balance into my life. 
    And, there are the environmental benefits. 
    Working remotely reduces the need for commuting, thereby lowering my carbon footprint. 
    It’s a win-win for both me and the planet!
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Lastly, for pet owners, working from home is plus!
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #EAE4D5;">Work from the office</h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    While remote work offers unparalleled flexibility, there’s something undeniably 
    valuable about being in the office. One of the biggest advantages is the ability 
    to collaborate more easily with my team. Face-to-face interactions—whether in formal meetings 
    or casual hallway conversations—create a dynamic work culture that feels safe, inclusive, and highly creative.
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    In the office, I also find myself being more productive. 
    The physical workspace, the desk, the dual screens, it all contributes to an atmosphere 
    that’s focused and professional. The structure that comes with being in an office makes it 
    easier for me to concentrate on my tasks and stay on track.
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Additionally, working from the office allows me to clearly separate my personal and professional lives. 
    I leave my home, go to the office, and focus entirely on my work. When the day ends, I feel like I’ve 
    completed a chapter, and it becomes easier to feel at home (when I go home). 
    It’s like flipping a switch, I can relax, recharge, and switch off from work.
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #EAE4D5;">Drawbacks</h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Of course, no work setup is without its challenges. 
    Remote work isn’t always as productive as it might seem. 
    For instance, the flexibility of working from home can sometimes be a double-edged sword. 
    There are days when I’m so comfortable and relaxed in my environment that I forget I’m supposed to be working. 
    My mind can wander, and before I know it, I’ve spent too much time on personal tasks instead of closing my 
    Jira tickets.
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Distractions are real. Without the structure of an office, 
    it’s easy to forget that I’m supposed to be in work mode. While remote work gives me freedom, 
    I’ve learned that too much of that freedom can be overwhelming. Some days I need the focus and be on track.
</p>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    That said, the office isn’t perfect either. 
    While I love the energy of in-person interactions, there are times when a few too many chatty 
    moments with coworkers can eat into my productivity. On days when my work besties are around, 
    we sometimes get lost in conversation and laughter, and time slips away without even realizing it.
