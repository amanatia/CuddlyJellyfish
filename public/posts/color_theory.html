<h4 style="margin-top: 50px; color: #EAE4D5;">What is color theory and who invented it?</h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Color theory is the study of how colors interact with each other and how 
    they can be used to communicate emotions, messages, and perceptions. It explores the psychological 
    and cultural impact of color and helps us understand why certain combinations work harmoniously,
    while others clash.

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    The foundations of modern color theory trace back to Isaac Newton’s 
    groundbreaking work in <i>Opticks</i>, where he conducted experiments with light and mapped the 
    results on a circular diagram, the earliest version of the color wheel.

<h4 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #EAE4D5;">How does color affect you?</h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    To truly understand if color theory works, try it yourself. Look at different 
    colors and think:
    <ul>
        <li>How does red make you feel?</li>
        <li>Does blue calm you down?</li>
        <li>Does yellow cheer you up or make you anxious?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #EAE4D5;">What Colors Represent</h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Here is a breakdown of what each color typically symbolizes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_symbolism">[2]</a>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Blue</b> – Calm, trust, loyalty, peace, depth, sadness, authenticity</li>

<h4 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #EAE4D5;"> Why does color thoery matter? </h4>

<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Well according to my research I found that human color categories (like red, blue, green) are not hardwired into 
    our brains. Instead they likely emerge from our need to efficiently and accurately communicate about our environment.


<p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    Cultures develop different ways of grouping colors based on how often those distinctions are useful or meaningful. 
    For example needing to tell ripe from unripe fruit. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2424069122">[3]</a>
    <br> Today color infuences how consumers perceive a product
    or service by triggering emotions they associate with that color.  For instance, a logo that is blue and white 
    often causes a calm, soothing response from a consumer. The colors red, orange, and black will evoke a different emotion. <br>
    The world makes sense because of the colors that surround us.
