    <h4 class="mt-4" style="margin-top: 50px; color: #EAE4D5;">Why is AI-generated art looked down upon?</h4>
    <!-- <p class="text-muted">Published on May 21, 2025</p> -->


    <p class="text-muted"  style="color: #F2F2F2;">That’s a question I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. Some people absolutely love AI art,
    others seem to hate it with a passion. I wanted to understand where this divide comes from. So, 
    I did what most of us do: I started reading. I browsed articles, forums, and comment sections to see what 
    people were actually saying. So here it is….</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4" style="margin-top: 30px; color: #EAE4D5;">Two Sides of a Growing Debate</h4>

    <p style="color: #F2F2F2;">On one side,
    there are those who see AI as a tool for empowerment. Supporters argue that AI-generated art opens up creative 
    expression to everyone, especially those who might not have had access to it before. People with physical 
    disabilities, limited resources, or no formal training can now bring their visions to life. They see this not 
    as a threat to art, but as a new chapter in creativity, one where everyone gets a voice.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
    And I get it,
    AI tools are cheap, fast and in general pretty good. For somebody  you is just starting on this journey of 
    creativity, that is a very big deal.But then there’s the other side. The worried side.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
        Many traditional
        artists feel that what they’ve spent years, even decades, learning is being undermined. Their skills, vision,
        and experience are being replaced by algorithms that don’t create, but generate. And worse, these algorithms
        were often trained on their work without consent.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
        It’s not about creativity, it’s about speed and 
        cost. It’s about replacing artists with machines to pump out content more efficiently, and that’s where
        the resentment comes from.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4" style="margin-top: 30px; color: #EAE4D5;">Beyond</h4>

    <p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
        Of course, I am not labeling people into one of the two 
        groups. I know some artists use AI as part of their process. And some AI enthusiasts are deeply respectful 
        of the artists whose work paved the way. But I believe that the tension on this topic is only going to grow.
        And the debate is going to become more and more personal.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
        As for me, I support the value of hard 
        work, dedication, and the human effort behind art. I do see potential in AI to make art more accessible. 
        However I don't want art to lose it's meaning and it' s purpose.
    </p>

    <p style="color: #F2F2F2;">
        I believe that what makes art  
        so valuable is it's ability to inspire and make others feel something real. What makes it real and special 
        is the authenticity and the process behind creating it. This AI 'art thing' just feels like a
        solution to a problem that never really existed.
